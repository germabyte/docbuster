# docbuster

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

**docbuster** is a user-friendly desktop application that helps users unlock password-protected PDF and Excel (`.xlsx`) files using two types of attack methods:
- **Numeric Brute-Force Attack**: Systematically tries numeric combinations of a user-defined length.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Tries passwords from one or more text files supplied by the user.

### Purpose & Problem Statement

Users often lose or forget passwords to their own PDF or Excel documents. Re-accessing these files without third-party services can be challenging. `docbuster` solves this issue by enabling users to attempt password recovery in a secure and local environment.

### Value Proposition

- Provides a **graphical interface** to select files and password lists.
- Supports **both brute-force and dictionary-based password recovery**.
- Works **entirely offline** to ensure privacy and data security.
- **No technical skills required** to operate.

## 4. User Guide (How to Effectively Use the Program)

### ü™Ñ Step-by-Step Usage

1. **Select a File**: Choose a PDF or Excel (`.xlsx`) file you want to unlock.
2. **Enter Digits**: Specify how many numeric digits the brute-force should try (e.g., 4 for `0000` to `9999`).
3. **(Optional) Add Dictionaries**: Select one or more `.txt` files containing potential passwords (one per line).
4. The program will first attempt numeric brute-force. If unsuccessful, it will try passwords from the selected text files.

### üí° Notes on Inputs & Outputs

- **Inputs Required**:
  - A password-protected `.pdf` or `.xlsx` file.
  - A number indicating how many digits to try.
  - (Optional) One or more `.txt` files with password lists.

- **Outputs**:
  - If the password is found:
    - PDF: Displays the working password in the terminal.
    - Excel: Decrypts and saves the file as `decrypted_[original_filename].xlsx`.
  - If no password is found: Displays a failure message.

## 5. Use Cases and Real-World Examples

### ‚úÖ Use Case 1: Forgotten PDF Password

- **Scenario**: A user forgets the 4-digit numeric password used to secure a financial report in PDF.
- **Action**: Runs `docbuster`, selects the file, and inputs `4` digits.
- **Result**: The program finds the password `0832` and displays it.

### ‚úÖ Use Case 2: Recovering Access to a Locked Excel Sheet

- **Scenario**: A business user needs to access a locked `.xlsx` sales report.
- **Action**: Selects the file and provides a text file of commonly used passwords.
- **Result**: The program finds the matching password from the list and saves a decrypted copy.

### ‚úÖ Use Case 3: Combined Attack

- **Scenario**: A user tries a 6-digit brute-force followed by a dictionary attack.
- **Action**: Selects both methods through the GUI.
- **Result**: Password found during the dictionary phase; file unlocked successfully.
